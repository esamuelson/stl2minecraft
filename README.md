Convert a STL to Minecraft Function

texture - specify the minecraft texture to use (everything must be the same texture)
input_file (STL file format, plaintext, not binary)
output_file (Output Minecraft Function)
Open Minecraft and Execute Function (FIXME: Add directions to run a function in minecraft)

It may be handy to use the move_all_points function to adjust the location (typically Y to be above ground).  


You need to install numpy-stl
